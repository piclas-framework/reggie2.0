## Installation
Installation can be done either done with the current workflow to keep an editable package for development, i.e.
```
git clone git@XXXXXXXX
cd reggie2.0
pip install -e .
```
Or without editing possibility directly via `pip` and `git` with
```
pip install git+https://github.com/XXXXXXXX
```
Reggie2.0 uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for maintaining code quality. Pre-commit can be installed with
```
pre-commit install
```
## Ruff linter and formatter

Reggie2.0 uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code linting and formatting of all .py files to maintain consistent code quality and style. Ruff is a fast Python linter and formatter that combines multiple individual tools like flake8, black, isort, etc.

### Pre-commit Integration

Ruff is integrated with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check and format code before each commit. The configuration is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and includes:

1. Ruff linter hook
2. Ruff formatter hook

All hooks can be tested with pre-commit before commiting your changes with
```
pre-commit run
```
Note that all pre-commit hooks only run on files that have been staged. The pre-commit hooks can be ignored with the additional flag
```
--no-verify
```


When creating a commit:
1. The linter will display errors immediately
2. The formatter will:
   - Fail if it finds issues
   - Apply automatic fixes
   - Unstage the modified files

After formatter changes:
- Review the applied changes
- Re-stage the files
- Try committing again (formatter should pass if no new changes were made)

Some linter errors can be fixed automatically with
```
ruff check --fix
```
while others require manual corrections.
Note that the flag `--unsafe-fixes` can change the functionality of the code, while `--fix` should keep it.

### Ruff configuration

Ruff's configuration is managed through the `pyproject.toml` file in the project root and specifies linting rules, checks, excludes, etc.

To suppress a violation inline, Ruff uses a `noqa` system similar to Flake8. To ignore an individual violation, add `# noqa: {code}` to the end of the line, like so:
```
# Ignore F841.
x = 1  # noqa: F841
# Ignore E741 and F841.
i = 1  # noqa: E741, F841
# Ignore _all_ violations.
x = 1  # noqa
```

Similar to the linter it is also possible to ignore code blocks for the formatter with
```
# fmt: off
_code_
# fmt: on
```
or a python specific block with
```
if condition: # fmt: skip
```

## Code Coverage
"In software engineering, code coverage, also called test coverage, is a percentage measure of the
degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite is run." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)

### gcovr: Coverage of the .f90 code
Reggie2.0 supports code coverage analysis using [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/). To enable code coverage:

1. Compile the executable with the `--coverage` flag in your build configuration.
   For example
    ```
    mkdir build_poisson_code_coverage && cd build_poisson_code_coverage
    cmake .. -DPICLAS_EQNSYSNAME=poisson -DPICLAS_TIMEDISCMETHOD=Leapfrog -DLIBS_USE_PETSC=ON -DPICLAS_CODE_COVERAGE=ON
    make -j
    ```
   This generates additional `.gcno` and `.gcda` files per object file, which track all compiled lines and the number of calls per line.

    **CAUTION**: The `.gcno` and `.gcda` files are **not** deleted by `make clean`! These files must be manually deleted before running new coverage tests,
    as they may be corrupted or retain results from previous runs.

2. Run reggie with the `-o` (or `--coverage`) option to generate the coverage report, for example

    ```
    reggie -e bin/piclas ../regressioncheck/CHE_poisson_p_adaption/Laplace_h_N1_pAdaptionType0/ -o 1
    ```

The `-o` parameter accepts an optional numeric argument to specify the output format: the default generates a `.json` file,
`1` enables additional `.html` output, and `2` produces `.xml` output.

All output files are stored in the `Coverage` directory. Separate reports are generated per build and then combined into a single report across all builds.
This combined report can be inspected as an HTML file at `Coverage/combined_report/html/combined_report.html`.
Other formats such as `.json` or `.xml` are used for combining reports or visualisation on GitLab.

Examples:
```
reggie -b /path/to/basedirectory /path/to/regressiontests -o
reggie /path/to/single/regressiontest -e /path/to/executable -o 1
reggie /path/to/single/regressiontest -e /path/to/executable -o 2
```

### Python coverage.py package: Coverage of the reggie2.0 code itself
It is also possible to generate a report of the reggie tool itself.
For this, each reggie call is wrapped with the [Python coverage tool](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/).
Make sure that the package is installed.
```
python3 -m pip install coverage
```
and then run the coverage tool
```
mkdir -p Coverage/reggie
COVERAGE_REGGIE_DIR="${PWD}/Coverage/reggie"
reggiecov() { coverage run -a --data-file=${COVERAGE_REGGIE_DIR}/.coverage --source=reggie -m reggie.reggie "$@" }
reggiecov -e bin/piclas ../regressioncheck/CHE_poisson_p_adaption/Laplace_h_N1_pAdaptionType0
```

This generates a coverage report of all used lines in the reggie module.
To convert the report to html, run
```
cd Coverage/reggie/ && coverage html && cd ../../
```
which should signal a successful html creation with `Wrote HTML report to htmlcov/index.html`.
The report can be inspected using the `Coverage/reggie/index.html` file.

```
firefox ./Coverage/reggie/htmlcov/index.html
```

## Table of Functions

The parameters used in `analyze.ini` and example arguments are given in the following table. Note that if you intend to use white spaces in variable names they must be supplied in form of `\s` in the variable name.
Example: `"Initial Timestep"` becomes `"Initial\sTimestep"` (or `"Initial\s Timestep"`) because all white spaces are removed from the variable name automatically.
The intention of a white space must be stated explicitly.

## h5diff
* Compares two arrays from two .h5 files element-by-element either with an absolute or relative difference (when comparing with zero, h5diff automatically uses an absolute comparison).
* Requires h5diff, which is compiled within the HDF5 package (set the corresponding environment variable).

      `export PATH=/opt/hdf5/X.X.XX/bin/:$PATH`
* Requires h5py for checking if the datasets which are to be compared by h5diff are of the same dimensions.

  [http://docs.h5py.org/en/2.5.0/build.html](http://docs.h5py.org/en/2.5.0/build.html)

```

## h5diff (multiple files)
* Compares multiple arrays from multiple .h5 files element-by-element either with an absolute or relative difference (when comparing with zero, h5diff automatically uses an absolute comparison).
* Requires h5diff, which is compiled within the HDF5 package.

### Example with `h5diff_one_diff_per_run = F`
Each comparison defined in analyze.ini is performed in each run.
The following example considers two runs (e.g. the time step is changed between the runs) and compares two files with two separate reference files in each run, hence, multiple file output can be analyzed.

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**

```
! hdf5 diff
h5diff_file            = sharpSOD_State_0000000.100000000.h5        , sharpSOD_QDS_0000000.100000000.h5
h5diff_reference_file  = reggie_sharpSOD_State_0000000.100000000.h5 , reggie_sharpSOD_QDS_0000000.100000000.h5
h5diff_data_set        = DG_Solution                                , FieldData
h5diff_tolerance_value = 1.0e-12                                    , 1.0e-12
h5diff_tolerance_type  = absolute                                   , absolute
```

### Example with `h5diff_one_diff_per_run = T`
A different comparison is performed in each run, where each column in analyze.ini is only used for one of the runs.
The following example considers 4 runs (the polynomial degree is varied) and in every run only one file is compared with a reference file, which is different for each run.
This can be used when the mesh is varied in each run, e.g., Cartesian and split2hex meshes and the resulting .h5 files are used for comparison.

```
## h5diff (additional options)

### Dataset Sorting

* Further options include the pre-sorting of a dataset before the actual comparison via h5diff is
  performed. This circumvents problems when comparing arrays that are written in arbitrary order due to
  multiple MPI processes writing the dataset (currently only 2-dimensional m x n arrays are
  implemented)
* The sorting can be performed for rows `m` by setting `h5diff_sort_dim=1` or columns `n` by `h5diff_sort_dim=2`
* The corresponding variable is selected via `h5diff_sort_var`. Note that variables start at 0 and end at m-1 or n-1 for rows or columns, respectively.

The following example considers an 8 x 4481 array *PartData*, which is to be sorted by the values in
the first row (select the rows via `h5diff_sort_dim=1` and the variable `h5diff_sort_var=0`)

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**
```
! hdf5 diff
h5diff_file             = sphere_PartStateBoundary_000.00000010000000000.h5
h5diff_reference_file   = sphere_PartStateBoundary_000.00000010000000000_ref.h5
h5diff_data_set         = PartData
h5diff_tolerance_value  = 1.0e-2
h5diff_tolerance_type   = relative
h5diff_sort             = T
h5diff_sort_dim         = 1
h5diff_sort_var         = 0
```

### Dataset Re-Shaping
- datasets may be reshaped prior to comparison, e.g., made smaller by decreasing a dimension

The following example considers an 14497 x 12 array *PartData*, which is to be re-shaped to an 14497 x 11 array, effectively
removing the 12th column.

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**
```
! hdf5 diff
h5diff_file             = sphere_PartStateBoundary_000.00000010000000000.h5
h5diff_reference_file   = sphere_PartStateBoundary_000.00000010000000000_ref.h5
h5diff_data_set         = PartData
h5diff_tolerance_value  = 1.0e-2
h5diff_tolerance_type   = relative
h5diff_reshape          = T
h5diff_reshape_dim      = 0
h5diff_reshape_value    = 11
```

### Multiple dataset names
When the datasets in the file and reference differ, simply supply both names. Instead of
```
h5diff_data_set        = DG_Solution
```
simply add the second name and add the "\s" delimiter, because white spaces are always removed by default
```
h5diff_data_set        = DG_Solution\sField1
```
where "DG\_Solution" corresponds to the dataset name in *h5diff_file* and "Field1" to the dataset in *h5diff_reference_file*.

### Compare variables
This option allows for comparison of a single column of the selected dataset to avoid unnecessary computation. Simply provide the name of the attribute of the hdf5 file, which contains all names of the different columns in the dataset and additionally the name of the column, which should be compared.

Both variables also take '_' as placeholder when using more than one analyze to compare all variables.

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**

## vtudiff

* Compares the point, field and cell data arrays (if not empty) of two .vtu files for each array element-by-element either with an absolute and/or relative difference (depending on which tolerance values are given - if no tolerance is given both default values are used).
* Requires vtk for reading-in data to python.

  [https://pypi.org/project/vtk/](https://pypi.org/project/vtk/)

Note that piclas2vtk needs to be set as external, since otherwise no .vtu file is created for comparison.

vtudiff_absolute_tolerance_value   = 1.0
```

## vtudiff (additional options)

### Compare single array

For comparison of only one array simply add the array name with
```
vtudiff_array_name                 = DG_Solution
```
,where "DG\_Solution" is the array name in the .vtu file. This variable takes also '_' as placeholder, when using more than one analyze to compare all arrays.

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**

```
! vtu diff
vtudiff_file                       = single-particle_State_000.00000005000000000.h5           , single-particle_State_2_000.00000005000000000.h5

vtudiff_relative_tolerance_value   = 1.0e-2                                                   , 1.0e-2
vtudiff_absolute_tolerance_value   = 1.0                                                      , 1.0

```

## h5 array bounds check
* Check if all elements of a h5 array are within a supplied interval
* Requires *h5py* python module (analyze will fail if the module cannot be found)

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**

```
! check if particles are outside of domain at tEnd
check_hdf5_file        = tildbox_State_001.00000000000000000.h5
check_hdf5_data_set    = PartData
check_hdf5_span        = 2 ! 1: check array elements by rows, 2: check array elements by columns
check_hdf5_dimension   = 0:2
check_hdf5_limits      = -10.0:10.0
```

## Data file line comparison
* Compare a single line in, e.g., a .csv file element-by-elements
* The data is delimited by a comma on default but can be changed by setting "compare\_data\_file\_delimiter = :" (when, e.g., ":" is to be used as the delimiter)
* relative of absolute comparison
* Possibility to perform one comparison per run (e.g. supply 10 data and reference files for 10 different runs), default is true

### Example 1 of 4
Template for copying to **analyze.ini**

```
! compare the last row in Database.csv with a reference file
compare_data_file_name      = Database.csv
compare_data_file_reference = Database_reference.csv
compare_data_file_tolerance = 2.0
compare_data_file_tolerance_type = relative
compare_data_file_one_diff_per_run = T
```

Note that a comma is the default delimiter symbol for reading the data from the supplied file. The variable "compare\_data\_file\_delimiter" cannot be set as custom delimiter symbol "," because the comma is used for splitting the keywords in analyze.ini. However, other symbols can be supplied using "compare\_data\_file\_delimiter" instead of a comma.


### Example 2 of 4

When different runs produce different output (e.g. changing the initial conditions, here, the temperature is varied), multiple reference files can be supplied. The following example produces the same output file (Database.csv) but compares with different reference files (Database\_TX000K\_ref.csv).

```
! compare the last row in Database.csv with a reference file
compare_data_file_name      = Database.csv
compare_data_file_reference = Database_T1000K_ref.csv, Database_T2000K_ref.csv, Database_T3000K_ref.csv, Database_T4000K_ref.csv, Database_T5000K_ref.csv
compare_data_file_tolerance = 2.0
compare_data_file_tolerance_type = relative
```
### Example 3 of 4

Additionally, multiple output files (Database\_TX000K.csv) can be supplied in combination with multiple reference files (Database\_TX000K\_ref.csv). See the following example.

```
! compare the last row in Database.csv with a reference file
compare_data_file_name      = Database_T1000K.csv, Database_T2000K.csv, Database_T3000K.csv, Database_T4000K.csv, Database_T5000K.csv
compare_data_file_reference = Database_T1000K_ref.csv, Database_T2000K_ref.csv, Database_T3000K_ref.csv, Database_T4000K_ref.csv, Database_T5000K_ref.csv
compare_data_file_tolerance = 2.0
compare_data_file_tolerance_type = relative
```

Note that for this example, the number of supplied output files, reference files and runs must be the same.

### Example 4 of 4

Additionally, the tolerance type and value can be altered.

```
! compare the last row in Database.csv with a reference file
compare_data_file_name           = Database_T1000K.csv, Database_T2000K.csv, Database_T3000K.csv, Database_T4000K.csv, Database_T5000K.csv
compare_data_file_reference      = Database_T1000K_ref.csv, Database_T2000K_ref.csv, Database_T3000K_ref.csv, Database_T4000K_ref.csv, Database_T5000K_ref.csv
compare_data_file_tolerance      = 1e-2    , 5e-2    , 1e-10    , 1e-10
compare_data_file_tolerance_type = relative, relative, absolute, absolute
```

Note that for this example, the number of all varied parameters must be the same (in this case 4) otherwise it will not work.

## integrate data columns
* Integrate the data in a column over another column, e.g., x:y in a data file as integral(y(x), x, x(1), x(end)) via the trapezoid rule
* The data is delimited by a comma on default but can be changed by setting "integrate\_line\_delimiter = :" (when, e.g., ":" is to be used as the delimiter)
* special options are available for calculating, e.g., rates (something per second)

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**

```

Note that a comma is the default delimiter symbol for reading the data from the supplied file. The variable "integrate\_line\_delimiter" cannot be set as custom delimiter symbol "," because the comma is used for splitting the keywords in analyze.ini. However, other symbols can be supplied using "integrate\_line\_delimiter" instead of a comma.

## compare data column
* compares the data in a column with a reference file
* The data is delimited by a comma on default but can be changed by setting "compare\_column\_delimiter = :" (when, e.g., ":" is to be used as the delimiter)
* Comparison of several columns is possible by providing a list of the column indices
* If only a single column (e.g. from a large PartAnalyze.csv) is compared, it is possible to provide a reference file, which only contains a single column to reduce its size
* Possibility to perform one comparison per run (e.g. supply 10 data and reference files for 10 different runs), default is true
* Possibility to perform one comparison per restart file, default is false. Overwrites the one comparison per run parameter above, as the command line runs are one level above

```

Note that a comma is the default delimiter symbol for reading the data from the supplied file. The variable "compare\_column\_delimiter" cannot be set as custom delimiter symbol "," because the comma is used for splitting the keywords in analyze.ini. However, other symbols can be supplied using "compare\_column\_delimiter" instead of a comma.

## Compare across commands
* **Description:** compare data from corresponding runs of different commands, e.g. `cmd_*/run_0001` (= `cmd_0001/run_0001` vs. `cmd_0002/run_0001` vs. `cmd_0003/run_0001` vs. ...), `cmd_*/run_0002`, `cmd_*/run_0003`, etc.
* **Purpose:** allows to investigate e.g. the parallel efficiency in a strong scaling test, if the different command directories originate from an increasing number of MPI threads (command\_line.ini: `MPI=2,4,6,...`) and the PID is written to the csv-file
* data to be compared is a singular value per run, written to a csv-file and specified through row number (first line = 1) and column index (first column = 0)
* two referencing types are supported, specified through `compare_across_commands_reference`:
  * a value &ge; 1 is interpreted as command index (cf. directory names `cmd_0001`, `cmd_0002`, etc.), e.g. the value 1 would compare all data against that of the first command
  * the value 0 takes the average (arithmetic mean) of all extracted data as reference
* **Caution:** The default delimiter symbol for reading the data from the supplied csv-file is a comma. The variable `compare_across_commands_column_delimiter` cannot be set to character "," because the comma is used for splitting the keywords in analyze.ini. Any other delimiter symbol, however, is acceptable.

Template for copying to **analyze.ini**
```
compare_across_commands_file            = ElemTimeStatistics.csv    ! name of output file
compare_across_commands_column_index    = 5                         ! column index (starts at 0)
compare_across_commands_line_number     = 3                         ! line number (starts at 1)
compare_across_commands_tolerance_value = 0.2                       ! tolerance
compare_across_commands_tolerance_type  = relative                  ! absolute or relative comparison
compare_across_commands_reference       = 1                         ! command number for taking reference value (1,2,...), or 0 for average

```
Make sure to provide a file **command_line.ini** with multiple commands, e.g. for a strong scaling test
```
MPI=2,4,6,8

```

# Runs

### Exclude runs directly

In order to exclude runs see the following example
```
! =============================================================================== !
! Species1 - CH4
! =============================================================================== !
Part-Species1-MWTemperatureIC=1000,4000
Part-Species1-TempVib=2000,3000

! exclude combinations
EXCLUDE:Part-Species1-MWTemperatureIC=1000,Part-Species1-TempVib=3000
```

### Use the same parameter list for multiple parameters in parameter.ini

In order to exclude runs see the following example in which 10 runs are performed, but the parameters are exchanged parallely. Modify the `parameter.ini` file.
```
! =============================================================================== !
! Species1 - CH4
! =============================================================================== !
Part-Species1-MWTemperatureIC=crosscombinations
Part-Species1-TempVib=crosscombinations
Part-Species1-TempRot=crosscombinations
Part-Species1-TempElec=crosscombinations
! =============================================================================== !
! Species2 - CH3
! =============================================================================== !
Part-Species2-MWTemperatureIC=crosscombinations
Part-Species2-TempVib=crosscombinations
Part-Species2-TempRot=crosscombinations
Part-Species2-TempElec=crosscombinations
! =============================================================================== !
! Species3 - H2
! =============================================================================== !

Part-Species3-MWTemperatureIC=crosscombinations
Part-Species3-TempVib=crosscombinations
Part-Species3-TempRot=crosscombinations
Part-Species3-TempElec=crosscombinations
! =============================================================================== !
! Species4 - H
! =============================================================================== !
Part-Species4-MWTemperatureIC=crosscombinations
Part-Species4-TempElec=crosscombinations

crosscombinations=1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,6000,7000,8000,9000,10000
